<h1>BCT</h1>
<h2 id="WhatIs">What is BCT?</h2>
<p>
BCT, an acronym that stands for Behavior Capture and Test, is a dynamic analysis toolset built 
to support software developers in diagnosing faults and identifying components incompatibilities. 
</p>

<h2 id="BCTPhases">How does it work?</h2>
<p>
BCT works in four phases:
<ul>
<li>Capture Behavior</li>
<li>Derive Models</li>
<li>Detect Anomalies</li>
<li>Analyze Anomalies</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
In the first phase (Capture Behavior), software developers execute the test cases of their applications. 
They can execute any kind of test: unit, integration, or system. 
During tests execution BCT monitor the software components and capture information about their interactions. 
BCT records both sequences of inter-component method invocations and data exchanged between components.
</p>
<p>
In the second phase (Derive Models), BCT generates models that summarize and generalize the observed executions. 
In particular, BCT uses Daikon to generate properties about the exchanged data and kBehavior to generate finite state automata (FSA) 
that represent component interactions. 
For instance, if we monitor invocations of method addItem(Item it, int qt), we can automatically generate the property qt>0 that 
indicates a positive value for the quantity. Similarly, if we monitor the use of a library for accessing files, 
we can automatically generate an automaton that indicates that files are first open, then read several times and finally closed.
</p>
In the third phase (Detect Anomalies), 
BCT is used to monitor new executions. 
Developers can use BCT to monitor new executions in two different situations: 
when an execution of the software causes a failure, when a new configuration of teh softwrae is tested.
In the first case BCT helps software developers in identifying faults, in the second case 
it permits to identify components incompatibilities.
BCT compares the events generated during the monitored execution with the inferred models. 
Checking can take place either in-the-field, while the system is under use, or in-house, when a failing execution is 
replicated to debug a failure. 
Events that violate models, i.e., data values that violate properties and sequence of method invocations that are not accepted by FSA, 
are collected as anomalous events that deserve further investigations.
</p>
<p>
In the fourth phase (Analyze Anomalies), the detected anomalous events are filtered, 
aggregated and presented with suitable views to help developers in understanding the underlying problems.
</p>

<p>
BCT has been implemented as an Eclipse plugin that provides also a standalone library that permits to use BCT without Eclipse.
