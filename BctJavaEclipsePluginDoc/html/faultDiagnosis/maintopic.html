</head>

<body>
<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
Software developers can successfully use BCT to diagnose faults.
</p>
<p>
Figure 1 shows the activities performed by BCT to help 
developers in diagnosing faults:
<ul>
<li>Software developers define the components to monitor and use BCT to instrument these components with
 data-recording monitors.</li>
<li>Developers run the system tests, meanwhile the instrumented monitors record data about the executions.</li>
<li>BCT infers models that generalize the observed behavior.</li>
<li>Developers use BCT to instrument the system with checking monitors.</li> 
<li>While the system runs either in-the-field or in-house, during debugging sessions, 
BCT compares runtime data with models and identifies violations, i.e. behavioral anomalies</li>
<li>After a failure, developers use BCT to analyze anomalies. 
BCT filters out false positives, and correlate the remaining ones to help developers in the diagnosis</li>
<li>Developers then can use BCT to automatically interpret interaction anomalies.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="identifyTheComponents">Define a monitoring configuration.</h1>
<p>The first step of the technique is the identification of the components to monitor. 
This activity is performed by defining a <i>Monitoring Configuration</i> 
using the <i>Monitoring Configuration Wizard</i>.
</p>

<p>
In order to run BCT you need at least a Java project to monitor. After clicking on <b>File>New>Other...</b> developers can select 
<b>new Monitoring Configuration</b> within the <b>BCT</b> folder (see Figure 2). 
A wizard dialog will pop up asking for information about the Monitoring Configuration to create (Figure 3).
